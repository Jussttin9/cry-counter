# Cry Counter

## Context
My girlfriend cries a lot, for both good and sad reasons. She wanted me to create a cry counter for her to keep track of how many times she's cried throughout the year along with a fun, interactive UI T^T

## Design
My girlfriend did all the artwork and design of the website, which is displayed in this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/V7VeTL5zldMxWvhKT9bAma/Cry-Counter?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=WhqxxXWOfZaMeYi7-0) file.
